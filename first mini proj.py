# Exercise#5
# The task is to create a "Health Management System." Suppose you are a fitness trainer and nutritionist. You have to deal with three clients, i.e., (Harry, Rohan, Hammad). For each client, you have to design their exercise and diet plan.
# Instructions:
# •	Create a food log file for each client
# •	Create an exercise log file for each client.
# •	Ask the user whether they want to log or retrieve client data.
# •	Write a function that takes the user input of the client's name. After the client's name is entered, it will display a message as "What you want to log- Diet or Exercise".
# •	Use function
# Health Management System
# # 3 clients - Harry, Rohan and Hammad
#
# def getdate():
#     import datetime
#     return datetime.datetime.now()
#
# # Total 6 files
# # write a function that when executed takes as input client name
# # One more function to retrieve exercise or food for any client
# Solution:
print("Welcome to my Era of Fitness;)")
print("Our Registered Client's are listed below")
